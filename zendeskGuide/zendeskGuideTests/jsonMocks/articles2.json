Issue fields defined as \"required\" in JIRA will appear on the form regardless of configurations on this form.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note that only Support admins can configure these fields for their agents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115024643327/jirav4.png\" alt=\"jirav4.png\" /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All existing installations have been updated to the latest version of the JIRA app. No customer action is required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For information on working with the new app, see <a href=\"/hc/en-us/articles/203660196\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Setting up the JIRA for Zendesk Support integration</a> and </span><a href=\"/hc/en-us/articles/203660206\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the JIRA for Zendesk Support integration</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>FAQ</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Q: Can I use both the old app (v3) and the new one  (v4) at the same time? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: App v4 is designed to supersede the previous version. This means that after the upgrade to v4, the previous version will no longer be available. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Q: Do I need to do anything after upgrading to v4?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: The app will configured automatically and ready to use.
